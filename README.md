In the GKE architecture, the Spark Operator plays a key role in managing the Spark clusters that execute the Spark jobs submitted by Livy.

Here's a revised overview of the architecture, including the Spark Operator:

Prophecy is a data integration and ETL platform that allows you to create and run pipelines for processing data.

Livy is an open-source REST server that enables you to submit and manage Apache Spark jobs from a remote client. It runs on a cluster and provides an interface for submitting Spark jobs to the cluster.

The Spark Operator is a Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment and management of Spark clusters on Kubernetes. It provides a custom resource definition (CRD) for Spark applications and manages the deployment and scaling of Spark clusters based on the CRD.

You deploy Livy and the Spark Operator as Kubernetes resources in your GKE cluster.

You configure Prophecy to use Livy as the execution engine for Spark jobs by specifying the Livy endpoint URL in the Prophecy configuration.

You create and run pipelines in Prophecy. When you run a pipeline, Prophecy generates a Spark job that implements the pipeline logic and submits it to Livy for execution.

Livy receives the Spark job and forwards it to the Spark Operator, which launches a Spark cluster to execute the job.

The Spark cluster consists of one or more Spark driver and executor processes, which perform the data processing tasks specified in the pipeline.

When the job is complete, the Spark driver process sends the results back to Livy, which returns the results to Prophecy.

Prophecy displays the results of the pipeline run in the web interface.

Overall, the Spark Operator plays a critical role in managing the Spark clusters that execute the Spark jobs. When a Spark job is submitted to Livy, Livy forwards the job to the Spark Operator, which launches a Spark cluster to execute the job. The Spark cluster consists of one or more Spark driver and executor processes, which perform the data processing tasks specified in the pipeline.
